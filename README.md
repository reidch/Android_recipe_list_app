# Recipe Pot app

THE BRIEF

To-Do List

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.

MVP

You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare minimum details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task. Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.


THE PROJECT

I initially named the app Taste List but I decided that this was too close to tasteless and therefore had negative connotations so I renamed it Recipe Pot which was well received by the friends and peers I showed it to.

I am applying this to something I enjoy doing in my spare time - cooking. As a keen cook and a user of my phone/laptop in the kitchen and in the supermarket, it would be good to have one dedicated place for collecting recipes for later use. I applied this to the To-do List spec for my first substantial Java/Android project.

Using Trello to track my own progress and that of the development of the app.

I derived great satisfaction from producing a functional app which solved a problem. I'm even considering buying an Android tablet so that I can use my app to collect my own favourite recipes and then cook them in my kitchen. Friends and family were impressed and I found the whole process very rewarding.

LEARNING POINTS

Improved time management throughout the app development process, compared to my previous week-long project.

The use of compound buttons, namely the switch, and how to use OnCheckChangeListener in conjunction with the switch.
